# Pokémon Green Cards 🌿

A Flutter application that displays **Grass-type Pokémon Trading Cards** fetched from the [Pokémon TCG API](https://pokemontcg.io/).  
Users can browse card images with their names and tap any card to see a larger, zoomable version.  

This project was created as part of a **Flutter mobile and web development lab**.

## 🧠 Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)

AI tools such as **OpenAI ChatGPT ** were used during the development of this project **for learning and productivity assistance only**.  
AI was used to:
- Help debug CORS and timeout issues when calling the Pokémon API.  
- Provide code for automatic “offline fallback cards” to keep the app working when API access fails.  

> ⚠️ All AI-assisted code and text were reviewed, tested, and refined manually by the developer before inclusion.
